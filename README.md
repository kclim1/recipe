I just completed the HTML section on The Odin Project and will be attempting to build a website from scratch. I will update this page to include my reflections, problems encountered and the solutions to those problems. 
Came back at a later date to rearrange files. It is now easier to navigate and more efficient as the number of redundant paths have been reduced. 
Also added a style.css file to make it look more colorful.
